# üìä SaaS Subscription Performance Dashboard ‚Äî Power BI Project  

## üß† Project Objective  
To analyze **subscription revenue, customer churn patterns, and retention metrics** for a SaaS business using **Power BI**.  
This dashboard transforms subscription and payment data into actionable business insights for revenue optimization and customer retention strategies.

---

## üßæ Dataset Details  
The dataset was **generated using SQL Server** with custom SQL queries to simulate realistic SaaS business data including:  

- **Customers** ‚Üí CustomerID, Region, AcquisitionChannel (Organic, Referral, Sales, PPC, Partner)
- **Subscriptions** ‚Üí SubscriptionID, PlanType (Pro/Enterprise/Basic), Customer Status (Active/Churned)  
- **Payments** ‚Üí PaymentID, Amount, PaymentDate  
- **DimDate** ‚Üí Date dimension table for time-series analysis  

**Data Generation:** SQL scripts created tables, populated them with synthetic transactional data, and established relationships.

**Data Connection:** SQL Server database connected to Power BI Desktop via SQL Server connector.

üìÑ **SQL Scripts:** Custom T-SQL queries written to generate 2,000+ customer records with payment history and subscription details.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Modeling  
Star schema design with clean relationships:

| From | To | Relationship |
|------|----|---------------|
| `Customers[CustomerID]` | `Subscriptions[CustomerID]` | One-to-many |
| `Subscriptions[SubscriptionID]` | `Payments[SubscriptionID]` | One-to-many |
| `DimDate[Date]` | `Payments[PaymentDate]` | Many-to-one |

All tables cleaned and transformed in **Power Query** before loading to the data model.
